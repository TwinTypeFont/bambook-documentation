Vertical text is common across many East Asian weiting system(e.g.CJKV). But ironically, Flutter **does not** provide a native vertical text box. Bambook is here to save the day, allowing developers to quickly create vertical text layouts.

This project is a sub-project of Typexedra, built by [TwinType][1].
